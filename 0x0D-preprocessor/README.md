You create macros with the ‘#define’ directive. ‘#define’ is followed by the name of the macro and then the token sequence it should be an abbreviation for, which is variously referred to as the macro's body, expansion or replacement list. For example,

     #define BUFFER_SIZE 1024
defines a macro named BUFFER_SIZE as an abbreviation for the token 1024.
