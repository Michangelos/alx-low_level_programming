Variadic functions, also known as variadic functions or variadic functions, are functions in programming languages that can accept a variable number of arguments. This means that they can take a different number of arguments or a varying number of arguments each time they are called. Variadic functions are useful in situations where the number of arguments is not fixed or is determined dynamically. They are commonly used in languages like C, C++, and some scripting languages.

In C and C++, variadic functions are typically declared using the ellipsis (...) in the argument list. The most well-known example of a variadic function in C is printf from the C Standard Library, which can accept a variable number of arguments based on the format string.
Variadic functions are particularly useful in cases where the number of arguments isn't known at compile time, such as when creating generic or flexible functions or when implementing functions that provide dynamic formatting or behavior, as in the case of printf.
