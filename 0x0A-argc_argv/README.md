In C and C++ programming, argc and argv are commonly used to handle command-line arguments passed to a program when it is executed from the command line or terminal.

argc (Argument Count): argc is an integer variable that represents the number of command-line arguments passed to the program, including the name of the program itself. It counts the total number of elements in the argv array. argc is always at least 1 because it includes the program name as the first argument.

argv (Argument Vector): argv is an array of strings that stores the actual command-line arguments passed to the program. Each element of the argv array is a null-terminated C-style string (char pointer). argv[0] typically holds the name of the program itself, and argv[1] through argv[argc-1] hold the additional arguments provided by the user.
