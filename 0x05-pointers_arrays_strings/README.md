ON this topic we learnt about pointers, arrays and Dereferencing 

Dereferencing is a concept in computer programming and computer science, particularly in languages like C, C++, and pointers in memory management. It refers to the process of accessing the value stored at the memory location pointed to by a pointer variable. In other words, dereferencing a pointer means retrieving the actual data or object it points to, rather than the memory address itself.

In languages that use pointers, dereferencing is typically performed using the dereference operator, which is often represented by an asterisk (*) symbol. Here's a basic example in C:

int main() {
    int x = 42;           // Declare an integer variable x and assign it a value.
    int *ptr = &x;        // Declare a pointer variable ptr and point it to the address of x.

    int value = *ptr;     // Dereference ptr to retrieve the value stored at the address it points to.
    
    printf("The value of x is: %d\n", value);  // This will print: "The value of x is: 42"
    
    return 0;
}
